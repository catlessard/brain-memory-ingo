      <h2>Understanding Memory: Sensory, Short-Term, and Long-Term</h2>
      <p>Memory is the foundation of learning. It involves multiple stages and types, each playing a distinct role in how we process and use information.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sensory Memory:</strong> Briefly holds sensory information such as sights and sounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Short-Term Memory:</strong> Temporarily stores and manipulates limited information.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-Term Memory:</strong> Stores information indefinitely, including facts, events, and skills.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Memories are formed by strengthening synaptic connections through repeated activation. This process is known as long-term potentiation (Sousa, 2022).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Retention and Transfer in Learning</h2>
      <p><strong>Retention</strong> is the ability to store and recall information over time. <strong>Transfer</strong> is applying previously learned knowledge to new contexts. Both are essential for meaningful learning and can be enhanced through scaffolded instruction, retrieval practice, and real-world application.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Trauma and Its Effect on Memory</h2>
      <p>Trauma can alter brain regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, impairing memory consolidation, focus, and emotional regulation (Van der Kolk, 2014). Understanding these effects allows for trauma-informed instructional design that supports healing and learning.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Strategies to Improve Memory, Retention, and Transfer</h2>
      <h3>1. Make Meaningful Connections</h3>
      <p>Linking new information to prior knowledge strengthens memory and relevance, especially for trauma-affected learners.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Engage Multiple Senses</h3>
      <p>Incorporate visual, auditory, and kinesthetic elements to activate various brain areas and boost retention (Willis, 2010).</p>

      <h3>3. Practice Retrieval</h3>
      <p>Regular opportunities to recall information enhance memory consolidation and promote flexible application of knowledge (Brown, Roediger, & McDaniel, 2014).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>When educators understand how the brain processes and retains information, they can design instruction that is both effective and empathetic. Supporting memory and learning through science-based strategies helps create inclusive, engaging, and emotionally safe learning environments.</p>
